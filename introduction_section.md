# Internet Circumvention Technologies: VLESS+REALITY Implementation

## Abstract

This repository documents the implementation and analysis of VLESS+REALITY protocol for network traffic obfuscation in restrictive environments. The research demonstrates effective circumvention of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems through cryptographic traffic mimicry.

## Technical Overview

Modern internet censorship relies primarily on Deep Packet Inspection systems that analyze traffic patterns, protocol signatures, and behavioral characteristics. Traditional VPN protocols exhibit distinctive signatures that enable detection and blocking.

VLESS+REALITY addresses these limitations through:
- **Cryptographic Authenticity**: Genuine TLS handshakes with legitimate servers
- **Traffic Indistinguishability**: Statistically identical patterns to normal HTTPS traffic  
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: <5% latency overhead
- **Adaptive Configuration**: Dynamic target domain selection


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- VPS server (1GB RAM minimum)
- Domain name (recommended: Namecheap, Cloudflare)
- Basic Linux administration skills

### Installation

1. **Server Setup**
```bash
# Install Xray
wget -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XTLS/Xray-install/main/install-release.sh
sudo bash install.sh

# Generate configuration
./scripts/generate-keys.sh
```

2. **Configuration**
```bash
# Copy template and customize
cp configs/server-template.json /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json
# Edit configuration with your parameters
```

3. **Client Connection**
```bash
# Use generated client configuration
# Import into v2rayN, v2rayNG, or similar clients
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Limitations**:
- This tool provides protocol obfuscation, not endpoint anonymity
- Network metadata (timing, volume) remains visible
- Requires operational security practices for sensitive use cases

### Recommended Practices
- Use dedicated infrastructure for different purposes
- Implement connection timing randomization
- Regularly rotate server endpoints
- Maintain separation between sensitive and routine activities
