### AI Assistant Prompt for VLESS+REALITY Setup

**Ready-to-Use Prompt (Copy and Paste to Any AI)**

```
Act as an expert Linux system administrator and networking specialist. I need step-by-step guidance to set up a VLESS+REALITY server for bypassing internet censorship. This is for educational and legitimate privacy purposes only.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- I am a beginner and need very detailed, exact commands
- I want to set up VLESS with REALITY protocol on my VPS
- I have basic Linux command line access
- Walk me through each step and explain what each command does
- Ask me to confirm each step before moving to the next
- If something goes wrong, help me troubleshoot

MY SETUP:
- Operating System: [I will tell you: Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS etc.]
- VPS Provider: [I will tell you: DigitalOcean/Vultr/Linode etc.]
- Domain: [I will tell you my domain name]
- Server IP: [I will tell you my server IP]

WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:
1. Guide me through server preparation and security
2. Help me install Xray-core
3. Generate all necessary keys and IDs for me
4. Create the server configuration file
5. Start and test the service
6. Generate client configuration
7. Provide troubleshooting steps

REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE:
- Use VLESS protocol with REALITY security
- Masquerade as microsoft.com traffic
- Use port 443
- Provide both server and client configurations
- Include all commands I need to copy-paste
- Generate secure UUIDs and keys for me
- Test the setup works properly

CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE TO CUSTOMIZE:
```json
{
  "log": {"loglevel": "warning"},
  "inbounds": [{
    "port": 443,
    "protocol": "vless",
    "settings": {
      "clients": [{"id": "GENERATED_UUID"}],
      "decryption": "none"
    },
    "streamSettings": {
      "network": "tcp",
      "security": "reality",
      "realitySettings": {
        "show": false,
        "dest": "one.one.one.one:443",
        "serverNames": ["www.microsoft.com"],
        "privateKey": "GENERATED_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "shortIds": ["GENERATED_SHORT_ID"]
      }
    }
  }],
  "outbounds": [{"protocol": "freedom"}]
}
```

Start by asking me about my server details (OS, IP, domain) and then guide me through each step one by one. Make sure I understand what each command does before we proceed.

Remember:
- Give me exact commands to copy-paste
- Explain potential issues I might encounter
- Help me verify each step works before continuing
- Provide the complete client configuration at the end
- Include instructions for mobile apps (v2rayNG, etc.)

Begin by asking me for my server specifications and then start with step 1.
